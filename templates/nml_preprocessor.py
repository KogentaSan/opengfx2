#!/usr/bin/env python3

"""
Loads a pnml file and:
Populates with information from #import lines.
Removes comments to configure extra zoom and 32bpp alternative sprites.

Import lines in the pnml must be formatted:
#import "path/to/nml/file.nml"
Path must be relative, quoted, and no additional whitespace is tolerated.

Extra zoom and 32bpp alternative sprites are controlled by removing comment strings exactly matching:
"#ez " for extra zoom sprites
"#32 " for 32bpp sprites
(use "#32 #ez " for 32bpp extra zoom sprites)

Positional arguments:
1. base name (base pnml name with extension)
2. string including ez and/or 32 (if matched, include sprites of these types)
3. optional string "exclude_name_suffix" (if matched, do not append _8, _8ez, _32 or _32ez to the output file name)

Output:
nml file with the same name as the pnml file appended with type (_8, _8ez, _32 or _32ez)

Only updates the output file if the input file, imported files, or the script has been modified since the last time the output was generated.
